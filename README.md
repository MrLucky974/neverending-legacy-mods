## About
This repo contains various mods that tweak, enhance, or add new features to NeverEnding Legacy. Mods and updates will come whenever I feel like working on them, so don’t expect a regular schedule.

If you find a bug or something that’s broken, report it in the Issues tab as well.

No guarantees on if or when I’ll address them, but I do appreciate the feedback!
